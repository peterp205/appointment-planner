# A react written appointment planner made for Code Academy project
## I was struggling with React props and hooks maintaining order. Through this project I was able to apply useState and props effectively to create a functioning app.

# Useage
The useage of the app is pretty straight forward. All information is only locally stored and will not retain through re-renders of the browser, this is a planned out function as it's only the front end development. 

When opening the app you will have two navigation links at the top to switch between the appointment page and contacts page. Functionality is included to add a contact with name, number and email. You can also schedule a meeting on the appointments page, this is linked with the contacts so you must enter a contact before being able to schedule a meeting. 


# Learnt skills
- React project initialisation 
- useState
- Props in React ( this was one skill I was struggling with mainly due to naming conventions and ordering.)
- File structure on React
- Initalising a project on a local machine for React using Git Bash and VSCode studio
- Git repositories 
- First completed ReadMe file



# Future goals for project
- I would like to revisit this and see how I can better refactor some of the code
- Consider linking to a live server
- Introducing a login page to use it
- Add additional options fields for location, summary etc.
- Style changes
